# 1/ The first observation one can make is that there is a strong relation ship between supply and demand in term of average fare per city. 
# Indeed the Urban type of city account for the highest number of drivers making 2/3 of the total of drivers leading to the highest number of rides.
# A deeper dive into another set of data would be necessary to understand the average miles count per ride, but it seems logical that the distance being shorter in urban city with various point of interest from a point A to a point B, the number of rides are therefore more numerous.
# We can notice then that the urban average fare per city (24.6$) is around 30% cheaper than a rural onc (33.3$) where the amount of rides are much less, and also possibly longer since the point of interest could also be more distant from a point A to a point B.

# 2/The number of rides seems to be somehow proportional to the number of drivers regardless of the city type with a slight difference with the rural environment, where less people are in demand.
# The price increase in rural environment is possibly due to less concurence from one driver to another, and comes at a prime cost since the competition is less intense.
# Indeed it is often perceived that urban dense cities have other mode of transportation (subway, bus, trolley etc) than rural cities where people have one to two cars per household.
# Thus getting a lift through Pyber might be more unique and rare. It would be necessary to come with additional set of data to understand what type of population drives this trend.

# 3/ There is a strong concentration of rides in Urban cities finding a sweet spot of 25$ on average per ride for the highest number of drivers. That price seems to be competitive and came naturally as a mean value from the dataset.
# Thus it can be estimated that any ride above that price would induce an additional prime cost of few dollars more trending toward either more distance to ride or a higher peak cost due to the demand/supply at different time of the day.
# Additional data would be necessary to understand the time of the day that people take Pyber as a mode of transportation to figure out what is the reason of the cost.
# A 25, median, 75 percentile chart would be interesting to look at. That being said, with the current data, it is clear that that the highest averaged fare per city in rural area is twice more than the average one in Urban area.

#4/ Overall the scatter plot reveal a pretty clear "hockey stick" curve showing that supply and demand are linked together.
# Indeed the less the rides taken, the more it costs, the more the rides taken, the less it costs.
